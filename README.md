# burger

## Description 

This project was created for a user to keep track of various burgers in a mySQL database. They can input whether or not the burgers have yet been
eaten. This project uses mySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM. 
The most difficult part of the project has been attempting to get the application to deploy to Heroku.

## Installation
